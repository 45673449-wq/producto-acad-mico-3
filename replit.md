# Flask Items API

## Overview

This is a Flask-based REST API for managing items. The application provides CRUD operations for items with a simple data model consisting of an ID, name, and description. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and supports both development (SQLite) and production database configurations. The project includes comprehensive test coverage using pytest.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
- **Flask**: Chosen as the web framework for its simplicity and flexibility
- **Factory Pattern**: Uses an application factory (`create_app`) to support different configurations for testing and production
- **Modular Design**: Database engine and URL configuration are parameterized for easy testing and deployment

### Database Layer
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Provides database abstraction and object-relational mapping
- **SQLite**: Default database for development and testing (file-based: `app.db`)
- **In-memory SQLite**: Used for testing to ensure test isolation
- **Declarative Base**: Uses SQLAlchemy's declarative approach for model definition

### Data Model
- **Item Model**: Simple entity with id (primary key), name (required), and description (optional)
- **Session Management**: Manual session handling with explicit creation, commit, and cleanup

### API Design
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Follows REST conventions for resource manipulation
- **JSON Communication**: Request and response data in JSON format
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for required fields

### Testing Strategy
- **pytest Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with fixtures for app and client setup
- **Isolated Testing**: Each test uses a fresh in-memory database
- **Test Coverage**: Includes success scenarios, error cases, and edge conditions
